                <p>to check the width of the device on which the website was first loaded on, we can use "window.matchMedia" method.</p>
                <code><pre>
const media = window.matchMedia('(width &lt; 40em)');

function setupTopNav(e) {
    if (e.matches) {

                <p>"inert" attribute is used to hide element from the accessibility tools.</p>
                <p>The inert global attribute is a Boolean attribute indicating that the browser will ignore the element.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prevents the click event from being fired when the user clicks on the element.</li>
                    <li>Prevents the focus event from being raised by preventing the element from gaining focus.</li>
                    <li>Hides the element and its content from assistive technologies by excluding them from the accessibility tree.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The inert attribute can be added to sections of content that should not be interactive. When an element is inert, it along with all of the element's descendants, including normally interactive elements such as links, buttons, and form controls, are disabled because they cannot receive focus or be clicked.</p>
